This project is a result of the Cooper Union's Benjamin Menschel Fellowship Program and came out of desire to reflect on the intersection of dance, body tracking technology and mobility and explore the posibilities of interactivity between dancers and bodytracking technology in performance. We investigate current use of technology for dance performances resulting in an interactive installation which connected the Kinect body tracking and generative visual graphics using Processing, a graphical library and programming language. The project exposed some limitations in access to hardware components of body tracking such as the Kinect camera.

On this repo, you will find documentation of this projects exhibition at the Lubalin Gallery as part of the Menschel Fellowship exhibit and in the Civic Projects Lab as part of miliLab's Digital Movement exhibit. You will also find set up instructions and resources such you can build similar projects that connect Kinect's body-tracking to Processing graphics.

# Menschel Fellowship Exhibition
give explanation and link to Menschel fellowship

# Digital Movement Exhibition
give intro to mililab and purpose of exhibition

# Processing and Kinect V2 SetUp
explain what is processing is, include link

This is the best tutorial to follow (https://mikebridge.github.io/post/kinect-and-processing/)
Mike Bridge’s blog uses Thomas Sanchez Lengeling’s Processing Library for using the Kinect V2

Thomas Sanchez Lengeling’s Processing Library requires Processing 3 (https://github.com/ThomasLengeling/KinectPV2)

Explain how Kinect V2 is out of production and the only way to get it is second hand on ebay or amazon

Give explanation on how to access joint info
