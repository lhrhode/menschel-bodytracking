# Reflections on Dance, Mobility, and Bodytracking
![Menschel_Exhibition073 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71452451/231338377-55c37385-0db7-4615-b4f7-b393ede7495b.jpg)

This project is a result of the Cooper Union's Benjamin Menschel Fellowship Program and came out of desire to reflect on the intersection of dance, body tracking technology and mobility and explore the posibilities of interactivity between dancers and bodytracking technology in performance. We investigate current use of technology for dance performances resulting in an interactive installation which connected the Kinect body tracking and generative visual graphics using Processing, a graphical library and programming language. The project exposed some limitations in access to hardware components of body tracking such as the Kinect camera.

On this repo, you will find documentation of this projects exhibition at the Lubalin Gallery as part of the Menschel Fellowship exhibit and in the Civic Projects Lab as part of miliLab's Digital Movement exhibit. You will also find set up instructions and resources such that you can build similar projects which utilize Kinect's body-tracking with Processing graphics.

# Menschel Fellowship Exhibition
[The Benjamin Menshel Fellowship Program](https://cooper.edu/academics/research-fellowships/benjamin-menschel-fellowship-program) supports interdisciplinary work in the fields of art, architecture, design, and engineering and funds students who propose scholarly, independent projects to expore creative inquiry in their education endeavors at The Cooper Union.

The program culminates in an annual exhibition and gala opening. Each project contributes to a [catalog](https://cooper.edu/academics/research-fellowships/menschel-catalogs). Our project is recorded in the [2023 Menschel Fellowship Exhibition Catalog](https://cooper.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/assets/development/menschel%20catalogue_ML.pdf).

# Digital Movement Exhibition

Much of this work was supported by Cooper Union's [miliLab](http://faculty.cooper.edu/mili/miliLab/index.html) and Prof. Mili Shah. This project was presented again at miliLab's Digital Movement Exhibition, an exhibition funded by the Cooper Union Presidential Grant to present the work and research conducted by the students of miliLab and present bodytracking technologies to the wider public.

# Processing and Kinect V2 SetUp
explain what is processing is, include link

This is the best tutorial to follow (https://mikebridge.github.io/post/kinect-and-processing/)
Mike Bridge’s blog uses Thomas Sanchez Lengeling’s Processing Library for using the Kinect V2

Thomas Sanchez Lengeling’s Processing Library requires Processing 3 (https://github.com/ThomasLengeling/KinectPV2)

Explain how Kinect V2 is out of production and the only way to get it is second hand on ebay or amazon

Give explanation on how to access joint info
